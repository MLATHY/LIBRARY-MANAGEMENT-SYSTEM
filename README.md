# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Library Management System is a console-based application developed in Java, using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It is designed to help manage library operations more effectively, accurately, and quickly. The system includes three main user roles: Admin, Librarian, and Reader, each with different menus and functions based on their responsibilities and permissions. Its main features include managing book information (both printed and electronic books), managing users and assigning roles, recording and checking borrow/return transactions, and searching and viewing book statistics. All data is stored in simple text files such as `books.txt`, `users.txt`, and `transactions.txt`, which helps keep the system lightweight and easy to run in a console environment.
