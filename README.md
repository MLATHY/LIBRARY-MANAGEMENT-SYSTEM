# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Library Management System is a console-based application developed in Java, using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It is designed to help manage library operations more effectively, accurately, and quickly.
The system includes three main user roles: Admin, Librarian, and Reader, each with different menus and functions based on their responsibilities and permissions.
Main features of the system:
•	Managing book information (both printed and electronic books)
•	Managing users and assigning roles
•	Recording and checking borrow/return transactions
•	Searching and viewing book statistics
All data is stored in simple text files such as books.txt, users.txt, and transactions.txt. This helps keep the system lightweight and easy to run in a console environment.
